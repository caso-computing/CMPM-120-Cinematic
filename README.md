# CMPM-120-Cinematic


3+ distinct visual scenes (with distinct “Scene” classes)
  - First scene depicts the imaginary gaming studio of spawn point studios
  - Second scene is a combination of scenes that introduces the auidence to the setting of the imaginary game and who they will be playing
  - Third scene is of the game menu where there are buttons to play or exit the game if they actually directed towards something

2+ audio assets (e.g. background music and a sound effect)
  - There is a respawn sound effect that I had to raise the volume of in the first scene
  - There is a running sound effect that I made myself to go with the animation of the first scene
  - There is a thudding sound effect for when the stick figure runs into the wall which I had to lower the sound levels for 
  - There is an explosion sound effect after each multi thread of text which I had to lower the volume for as well
 
2+ image assets (one with transparent background)
  - I made the stick figures in photoshop
  - Mr. Clean came from the Mr.Clean brand
  - The sunglasses are a stock png photo that a photoshopped onto Mr.Clean
  - The explosion is a stock png photo that I edited the color levels in photoshop and changed the opacity of it in phaser
  
2+ geometric shapes (rendered in-engine)
  - I made two rectangles for the first scene 
  - I made a green triangle in the first scene

1+ big fancy text (composed out of engine)
  - SpawnPoint Studios is a font that I was able to create using this website https://www.fontspace.com/category/8-bit

1+ multi-line text (rendered in-engine)
  - There are multiple multi-lines of text in scenes 2 and 3 

1+ fading scene transition (e.g. fade to black)
  - all scenes have a fade in and fade out except for the last scene 

1+ object motion animation (e.g. sliding in from the side)
  - The stick figure in the first scene moves from left to right twice
